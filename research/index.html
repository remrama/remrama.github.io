        Broadly, I'm interested in how cognition fluctuates across the circadian cycle. <em>Wake and sleep</em> are more complicated than <em>on and off</em>. To better understand how we retain mental information generally, I study working memory in waking humans . The best demonstration, I think, of how sleep is not a strictly "off" state comes from lucid dreaming. When someone becomes lucid in their dream, they regain waking levels of mental awareness and determine correctly that they are dreaming <em>as the dream is occuring</em> (i.e., without waking up). The goal of my work is to study mental faculties across the entire circadian cycle to uncover the building blocks of human cognition.

        Below I've grouped my research projects into these two broad categories.

    <h2>Working memory research</h2>
    
    <h3>The intersection of working memory, perception, and attention</h3>
    <p class="tab">
        Perception and working memory recruit similar neural systems. A red stop sign will grab your perceptual attention if you are in the holding a red in mind to look for your friend who is in a red coat. But we hold more than one item in mind at any given time, and it is unclear as to how switching <em>internal</em> attention between memories impacts the way they influence perception. By applying machine-learning techniques to behavioral data, we showed that this is not the case for all memory items. By temporarily switching internal attention away from a memory item, it no longer interacts with the environment. This work was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13647"><em>Annals of New York Academy of Sciences</em></a>.

    <h3>The impact of distraction on working memory</h3>
    <p class="tab">
        We use working memory all day, at which time we are also bombarded with incoming perceptual information. How does the brain do both simultaneously? What prevents perception from interrupting or even overwriting mnemonic information? We found that directing internal attention towards or away from mental contents influences the amount of disruption caused by a distracting task. This work is currently under review, while materials are available on the <a href="https://osf.io/xz3ap/">OSF project site</a>.

    <h2>Lucid dreaming research</h2>
    
    <h3>Phenomenology</h3>
    <p class="tab">
        What is it <em>like</em> to be lucid? Just like wake/sleep is not simply on/off, one is not simply <em>lucid or not</em>. Rather, it falls on some type of spectrum. We asked participants after awakening about how lucid their dream was, and also followups about why they reported their dream as such. This work was recently presented as a poster at the 2019 IASD conference, and the manuscript is currently in prep.

    <h3>Induction</h3>
    <p class="tab">
        Perhaps the largest roadblock to the use of lucid dreaming in research is its infrequency. Thus, the most immediate goal in lucid dreaming research is to develop a reliable method of inducing lucid dreams. To this aim, we have developed a novel induction method that aggregates previous methods that have shown to be moderately effective individually. This manuscript is currently being reviewed.
    </p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p class="tab">
        Since lucid dreamers are aware they are dreaming, they are also aware of the waking or "outside" world while they are asleep. Though surrounded by internal mental contents, lucid dreamers can try to communicate with a waking person. Though muscle atonia leaves most of the sleeping body paralyzed, actions of the dreamer often result in subtle muscle twitches which can be read out with polysomnography or other measures. My Bachelor's thesis was a project where a few participants tried to control a consumer brain-computer interface during a lucid dream. <a href="https://osf.io/mr7hf/">And it kinda worked!</a> Our newer work revolves around <a href="https://github.com/remrama/flicker">a closed-loop device</a> that can detect intentional eye signaling from a lucid dream and respond to the dreamer with audio.
