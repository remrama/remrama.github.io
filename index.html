    <h1>Hello, I'm Remy.</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a cognitive neuroscience PhD student working in the <a href="https://lewpealab.psy.utexas.edu/">LewPea Lab</a> at University of Texas at Austin. There I'm studying working memory in awake humans, and I'm also interested in lucid dreaming, where waking levels of cognition "reappear" during sleep. Here I have <a href="/research">informal</a> and <a href="/cv">formal</a> summaries of my work.
