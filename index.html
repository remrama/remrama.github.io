        <b><span style="font-size: 2em">Hi,</span></b> I'm Remy, a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://pallerlab.psych.northwestern.edu/">Ken Paller's lab</a> at Northwestern University. My research focuses on sleep, dreams, and mood, with an emphasis on the characterization and potential benefits of lucid dreaming (when waking levels of cognition reappear during sleep). I recently received a cognitive neuroscience PhD from University of Texas at Austin while working in the <a href="https://lewpealab.psy.utexas.edu/">LewPea Lab</a>.
