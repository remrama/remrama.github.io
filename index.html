        I'm a cognitive neuroscience PhD student working in the <a href="https://lewpealab.psy.utexas.edu/">LewPea Lab</a> at University of Texas at Austin. There I'm studying working memory in awake humans, and I'm also interested in lucid dreaming, where waking levels of cognition "reappear" during sleep.
