        <b><span style="font-size: 2em">Hi,</span></b> I'm Remy, a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://pallerlab.psych.northwestern.edu/">Ken Paller's lab</a> at Northwestern University. My research focuses on memory, sleep, and dreams, with an emphasis on the characterization and potential benefits of lucid dreaming (when waking levels of cognition reappear during sleep). I recently finished a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from University of Texas at Austin working in the <a href="https://lewpealab.psy.utexas.edu/">LewPea Lab</a>.

        Most of what I'm currently working on is touched on in <a href="https://youtu.be/iH2FUE8OC9w?t=4113">this talk</a>.
